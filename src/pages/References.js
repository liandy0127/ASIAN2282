    <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>From References to Stories</h2>

    <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>DOHA</h3>
    <p>The articles I explored became the backbone of my narrative, each contributing to my vision of Doha’s cultural, technology, and environmental transformation.</p>

    <p>Boussaa’s Urban Regeneration and Furlan and Ellath’s Regeneration Planning deeply influenced my portrayal of Souq Waqif. These works emphasized Qatar’s efforts to preserve heritage while embracing modernization, inspiring me to depict traditional mud-brick alleys and handcrafted wares thriving alongside holographic maps and AI-enhanced tools. The blend of old and new felt essential to Doha’s story.</p>
    <p>Furlan and Marthya’s Placemaking Strategy shaped my scenes at the spice vendor’s shop and the Falcon Hospital. This article highlighted Souq Waqif’s role as a cultural hub, inspiring me to imagine AI-driven perfume machines and advanced falcon diagnostics coexisting with ancient traditions like falconry.</p>
    <p>Qatar Cool’s Our Districts gave me the foundation for West Bay’s solar-powered cooling towers and climate-controlled boulevards, symbols of Qatar’s focus on sustainable urban development. Harkness’s Changing Qatar and the U.S. report on religious freedom helped me capture Doha’s cultural inclusivity. Mwale’s Kenyan restaurant and the Global Religious Symbiosis Center with VR-driven interfaith experiences reflect Qatar’s celebration of diversity.</p>
    <p>The Million Tree Initiative inspired ecological restoration with neem trees revitalizing deserts, while the Ministry of Environment’s camel conservation efforts informed my camel herder narrative. Together, these sources helped me reimagine Doha as a city where heritage, innovation, and sustainability intertwine, creating a vision of its ambitious future.</p>

    <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>SINGAPORE</h3>
    <p>The references I choose includes singapore’s initiatives to protect hawker culture, government-funded project of Tengah, and also inspired a cyberpunk fictional story in Geylang.</p>
    <p>The Ministry of Culture's report on hawker culture and Tan’s detailed analysis of hawker centers inspired my portrayal of Lau Pa Sat. These articles emphasized the resilience of heritage through government support and community pride, which helped me imagine a world where smoky satay stalls thrive amidst autonomous taxis and skyscrapers, blending tradition with innovation.</p>
    <p>The World Economic Forum’s overview of Tengah and Tai’s report on its environmental challenges influenced my depiction of Tengah as a utopian "Forest City." These articles highlighted both the ambitious design and the initial resistance from skeptics, which inspired Mrs. Tan’s narrative and the ecological corridor that balances wildlife conservation with urban living.</p>
    <p>For Geylang, Chua’s academic exploration of urban policing and Yahoo News Singapore’s feature on a cyberpunk Singapore shaped my gritty, neon-lit district. These works inspired the chaotic fusion of futuristic tech and shadowy crime in Geylang, from holographic guards to cybernetic underworlds. They fueled the tension in my story, showcasing the darker side of a hyper-modern city.</p>
    <p>Together, these articles guided me to create a nuanced story where culture, technology, and human challenges intertwine, imagining a Singapore that straddles tradition and futurism.</p>

    <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>KYOTO</h3>
    <p>The references provide rich insights into Kyoto’s ongoing initiatives to balance modernization and heritage preservation and how the city reacts to overtourism.</p>
    <p>The journey begins with Kyoto's traditional townhouses, or machiya. Efforts like the "Machiya Regeneration Fund," based on Suebsuk’s study on conservation, and Stonebridge’s exploration of machiya restoration, influenced the depiction of Yumika’s family restaurant and the new developments mimicking machiya style. These details emphasize the tension between preserving authenticity and modern commercialization.</p>
    <p>The story moves to Fushimi Inari Shrine, where sustainable tourism practices ensure its preservation. Topics Japan’s discussion on overtourism at iconic temples and Murakami’s SpringerLink chapter on visitor management inspired the reservation systems and eco-friendly vending machines in my story. These elements reflect Kyoto's real-life strategies to maintain sacred spaces amidst tourism pressures.</p>
    <p>The threads of Nishijin weaving, inspired by Shimizu Art Foundation’s exploration of traditional textiles and AI integration, symbolize how Kyoto revitalizes its crafts while attracting younger generations. Similarly, Kyodo News’ coverage of kabuki performances for global audiences shaped my portrayal of Minami-za Theater. The use of VR and AI in kabuki mirrors Kyoto’s initiatives to make traditional artforms accessible while engaging modern viewers.</p>
    <p>Through these articles, I imagined a Kyoto where the interplay of tradition and technology creates a harmonious future.</p>
